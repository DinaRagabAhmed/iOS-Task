# Documents list App
## by Dina Ragab

### No RxSwift, No Moya or Alamofire , No infinite scrolling libraries, tried to use iOS SDK only with those modules.

### Assumptions
- All this assumptions can be changed based on the requirements:
  - Author name is array of strings so this array will be displayed comma separated in documents list and document details but when user click on it in details, user will search with only first name in array.
  - When user search by document author or by document title and add characters in search bar it
    will also search by the same criteria (document author or by document title) and only back to
    the original status (Search by query) when user clear all text in search bar.
  - User can search when he clicks on search button in design or search button in keyboard.
